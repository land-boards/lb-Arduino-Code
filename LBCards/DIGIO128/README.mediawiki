* These are the [http://land-boards.com/blwiki/index.php?title=DIGIO-128 DigIO-128 card related] files.

=== Files ===

==== D128FAT ====

* Original Factory Acceptance Test for the DigIO-128 card
** Replaced by [https://github.com/douggilliland/lb-Arduino-Code/tree/master/LBCards/ODAS ODAS Test Station Software]
* Uses an Arduino UNO with a Host USB connection
* Requires 8 loopback cables (10 pin 1:1 jumper cables)
* Performs loopback testing from one chip to the next (0-1, 2-3, 4-5, 6-7 chips)
* Also, attempts to program the EEPROM and presents the result if successful
* Runs with Host Serial Connection
* Loops on running the loopback test forever - good for endurance testing

==== D128LEDS ====

* Move the light around 128 LEDs
* Uses a [http://land-boards.com/blwiki/index.php?title=GVSDuino GVSDuino card]

==== D128Loopback ====

* The FAT code isolated for the 128-bit loopback
* Loops on running the loopback test forever - good for endurance testing

==== D128Utils ====

* D128eep - EEPROM test portion isolated
** Programs the EEPROM in the DigIO-128 Card
** Uses an Arduino UNO with a Host USB connection
** Standalone version of the eeprom code contained in the D128FAT
** Write, read and check functions
* D128Loop - Loopback test portion isolated
* D128mcp - MCP23017 expansion from single chip to 8 chips

=== Ownership ===

* Some of these files (particularly libraries) were created by others.
** There may be newer versions of these libraries "out there".
** Some libraries even have the same names but don't work the same.
* Many of these files were created by me based on the work of others.

=== Warning ===

* Use at your own risk.
** If you brick your part or it melt to a puddle, it's on you not me.
