* These are our [http://land-boards.com/blwiki/index.php?title=PROTO16-I2C PROTO16-I2C card related] files.
** These files were created to exercise our [http://land-boards.com/blwiki/index.php?title=PROTO16-I2C PROTO16-I2C card].

== Features ==

* 16-bit Digital I/O card
** [http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/21952b.pdf MCP23017] 16-bit I2C I/O Expander
** Strong library support for all major microprocessors for MCP23017
* I2C Interface - Two Wire Interface
** Can run at 400 KHz or faster
* I/O Connector is inexpensive/standard DB-25
** Fuse protected power output on DB-25 with jumper bypass
* Large prototyping area
** Connections at edges to DB-25 and GPIO lines
* EEPROM for board ID and application specific information
** Write Enable jumper protects against accidental writes
* [[Open Data Acquisition System]] (ODAS) form factor (width is 95 mm)
* Host connectors
** Daisy-chain I2C connector
** Address select jumper
** Expandable I2C via [[I2C-RPT]] - I2C Repeater
** Interrupt out/Card Present
** Power connector (not required for minimal loads)
*** Reversible pinout for safety
** I2C Termination jumpers for end of I2C chain
* Power can be 3.3V or 5V
* 95mm wide [[Open Data Acquisition System]] format
* 6-32 Mounting holes

=== Prototyping Area ===

* Large prototyping area
* Ideal for through-hole ICs
* Extra I/O Rows on both sides
** One side connects to DB-25 connector
** Other side connects to MCP23017 pins
* Prototyping area in the center of the card with power/ground bus up the middle two pins
** Easy connection to IC Power/Grounds
* Silkscreen on both sides of the card

=== Example Code ===

* PROTO16I2CBlink - Attach an LED to bit 0 and blink the LED
* PROTO16I2CLEDS16 - Blinks 16 lines one at a time
* PROTO16I2CFAT - EEPROM exercise code

=== Ownership ===

* Some of these files (particularly libraries) were created by others.
** There may be newer versions of these libraries "out there".
** Some libraries even have the same names but don't work the same.
* Many of these files were created by me based on the work of others.

=== Warning ===

* Use at your own risk.
** If you brick your part or it melt to a puddle, it's on you not me.
