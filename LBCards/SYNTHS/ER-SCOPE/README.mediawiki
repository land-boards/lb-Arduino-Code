== Features ==

* [https://note.com/solder_state/n/n6b4cc8d1c6b9 HAGIWO design]
* Differences from HAGIWO
** Using Arduino Pro Mini - smaller package than NANO
*** No USB but USB is not used after download anyway
** Using I2C OLED
*** Probably affects screen refresh rates
* OLED : 128*64 pixel 0.96inch
* Knob1: Rotary encoder for selection (including push switch)
* Knob2: GAIN
* Toggle SW : AC/DC switching
* TRIG IN : External trigger IN
* Input : Signal to be observed IN
** Observable voltage is 5 V p-p
* Output : Observable signal OUT (short circuit with INPUT)
