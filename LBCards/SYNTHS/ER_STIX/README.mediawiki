== Features ==

* Similar to [https://mutable-instruments.net/modules/branches/manual/ Mutable Instruments Branches]
** Dual Bernoulli Gate
* 4 output jacks
** OUT1A/OUT1B and OUT2A/OUT2B
* Differences vs Branches
** Only has 1 GATE input
** No push buttons
** 0-5V input/outputs
* Built on [[ER-PROTO-02]]
* [[Arduino Pro Mini]]
* 10-pin Eurorack power
** Uses +12V only

=== Operation ===

* Receives single Gate on J1
* RV1 controls OUT 1
* RV2 controls OUT 2
* RV3 is mode for OUT 1
* RV4 is mode for OUT 2

== Controls ==

* RV1 - Probabilistic ratio for Output 1
** Center = 50-50, CCW = Out1A on 100%, CW = 0% on OUT1B
** Inserting J3 jack disables RV1
* RV2 - Probabilistic ratio for Output 2
** Center = 50-50, CCW = Out1A on 100%, CW = 0% on OUT1B
** Inserting J3 jack disables RV1
* RV3 - OUT 1 Mode
** 7-12 o'clock = Normal Mode drives only OUT1A or OUT1B
** 12-5 o'clock = Drives both OUT1A and OUT1B
* RV4 - OUT 2 Mode
** 7-12 o'clock = Normal Mode drives only OU21A or OUT2B
** 12-5 o'clock = Drives both OUT2A and OUT2B
