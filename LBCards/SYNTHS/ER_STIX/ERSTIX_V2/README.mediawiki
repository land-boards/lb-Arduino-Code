= ER-STIX - Software Version 2 =

* [https://github.com/land-boards/lb-Arduino-Code/blob/master/LBCards/SYNTHS/ER_STIX/ERSTIX_V2/ERSTIX_V2.ino Still pretty simple - Version 2 code GitHub]
* Adds (2) mode control knobs
* RV3
** 7 o-clock = 12 o'clock = Normal mode
** 12 o-clock - 5 o=clock = Send Outputs on both OUTxA and OUTxB

== Latency ==

* Measured GATE in to OUT latency < 20uS using digitalRead and digitalWrite
* Improved by [https://docs.arduino.cc/hacking/software/PortManipulation accessing the ports directly]
** Measured at 2 uS

== Resources ==

* Arduino Pro Mini w/ ATMega168
