== Land Boards SD Loader Files ==

* These are the [http://land-boards.com/blwiki/index.php?title=Main_Page#Arduino_Compatible Land Boards Arduino Compatible Cards] code libraries and example files.
* There is also other people's code here.

=== Ownership ===

* Some of these files (particularly libraries) were created by others.
** There may be newer versions of these libraries "out there".
** Some libraries even have the same names but don't work the same.
* Many of these files were created by us based on the work of others.

=== Warning ===

* Use at your own risk.
** If you brick your part or melt it to a puddle, it's on you not us.
