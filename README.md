#land-boards Arduino Code

These are our [Arduino](http://arduino.cc "Arduino website") files. 

[The Wiki page for this code is here.](http://land-boards.com/blwiki/index.php?title=Arduino_Code) Most of this code was created to exercise our [Arduino compatible hardware](http://land-boards.com/blwiki/index.php?title=Board_Designs_by_Function#Arduino_Compatible_Boards).

##Ownership

Some of these files (particularly libraries) were created by others. There may be newer versions of these libraries "out there". Some libraries even have the same names but don't work the same. Many of these files were created by me based on the work of others.

##Warning

Use at your own risk. If you brick your part or it melts to a puddle, it's on you not me. Really!
