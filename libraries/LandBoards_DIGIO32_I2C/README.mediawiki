* begin(baseAddr) - Initialize the card
* void digitalWrite(uint8_t bit, uint8_t value) - write to a bit
* uint8_t digitalRead(uint8_t p) - read back a bit
* void PinMode(port, direction)- Set the direction of a bit (INPUT, OUTPUT, INPUT_PULLUP)
* void writeGPIOAB(chip,baData) - Write 16-bits of data at a time
* uint16_t readGPIOAB(chip) - Read 16-bits at a time
* void write32(uint32_t) - Write 32-bits
* uint32_t readGPIO32() - Read 32-bits

== Ownership ==

* Some of these files (particularly libraries) were created by others.
** There may be newer versions of these libraries "out there".
** Some libraries even have the same names but don't work the same.
* Many of these files were created by me based on the work of others.

=== Warning ===

* Use at your own risk.
** If you brick your part or it melt to a puddle, it's on you not me.
