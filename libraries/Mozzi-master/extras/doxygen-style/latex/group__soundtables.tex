Look-\/up-\/tables and python scripts to generate tables or convert sounds. Includes ready-\/to-\/use wave tables and a few example samples which are in the Mozzi/tables and Mozzi/samples folders. You can convert your own sounds from a program like Audacity to tables for Mozzi with a script called char2mozzi.\+py, in Mozzi/python. Read the int8\+\_\+t2mozzi.\+py file for instructions. Also check out the other scripts in the python folder for templates to use if you want to do your own thing.
