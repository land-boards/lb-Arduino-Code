Fixed point fractional number types and conversion routines. Fixed point is often best for fast audio code for Arduino, and these can ease some of the pain. \begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
Take care when converting that the important bits of your numbers will fit in the types you choose! 

Timing\+: converting between fixed and float 10-\/12us, converting between fixed types about 1us.
