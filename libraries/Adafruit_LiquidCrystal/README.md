# Adafruit_LiquidCrystal [![Build Status](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_LiquidCrystal/workflows/Arduino%20Library%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_LiquidCrystal/actions)[![Documentation](https://github.com/adafruit/ci-arduino/blob/master/assets/doxygen_badge.svg)](http://adafruit.github.io/Adafruit_LiquidCrystal/html/index.html)

This library has been renamed Adafruit_LiquidCrystal so as not to conflict with LiquidCrystal.
For use with liquid crystal displays (LCD) based on the Hitachi HD44780 (or a compatible) chipset,
which is found on most text-based LCDs. Also includes support for
[Adafruit I2C/SPI Character LCD Backpack](https://www.adafruit.com/product/292).

## Compatibility

Compatible with any board supported by the [Adafruit Bus IO Library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_BusIO).
