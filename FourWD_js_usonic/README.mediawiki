=== Hardware ===
* [http://www.makershed.com/product_p/mkseeed8.htm Four Wheel Drive (4WD) car by DFRobot] (I think at least. I got it at Makershed.)
* [http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardUno Arduino UNO]
* [http://www.makershed.com/product_p/mkad7.htm Motor Shield]
* 2-Axis Joystick. I am using the [http://www.parallax.com/tabid/768/ProductID/581/Default.aspx Parallax part sold by Radio Shack.]
* [http://letsmakerobots.com/node/30209 Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04]. I got mine for cheap from China (about 3.50 USD).

=== Operation ===
* Joystick has 7 positions, forward left, forward, forward right, back left, back, back right and stop. To stop let the joystick return to center.
* Ultrasonic sensor should stop the robot within 12 inches of the obstacle.
